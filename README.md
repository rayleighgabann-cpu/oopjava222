## About the Project: Vision & Mission

**Java Banking System** is more than just a console application; it is a simulation of a core banking engine designed to solve the problem of secure and consistent financial data management.

### The Core Idea
The main goal of the system is to bridge the gap between simple data storage and complex **business logic**. In a real world, money cannot simply "change variables"; it must move through strict transaction protocols. Our system ensures that:
1.  **Money never vanishes:** Every request is wrapped in a transaction with strict validation (ACID principles).
2.  **Every action is tracked:** A complete audit trail (history) is kept for every cent moved.
3.  **Security first:** Access is strictly divided between **Admins** (who monitor the system) and **Clients** (who use it), preventing unauthorized access to critical functions.

### Educational Value
This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in:
* Building scalable **MVC architectures** without frameworks (pure Java).
* Handling complex SQL relationships (`JOIN`, Foreign Keys) manually.
* Implementing industry-standard patterns (**Singleton**, **Factory**, **DAO**) to solve architectural challenges.
